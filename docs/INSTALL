INSTALLATION

1) Create a directory called "dystill" in your roundcube plugins/ directory.

2) Extract the contents of this archive into that directory.

3) Copy config.inc.php.dist to config.inc.php and edit the database settings to
   so that RoundCube can connect to the database where your dystill filters are
   stored.
   
4) Edit the config/main.inc.php for your roundcube installation. Find the
   $rcmail_config['plugins'] setting, and add "dystill" to the array of enabled
   plugins.
   
That's it! Go test it to be sure, then you can start creating/editing rules.
